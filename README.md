# Upstat
    
> simple and easy-to-use self-hosted status monitoring tool

## Features

It needs more features but for now...

-   Monitoring uptime for HTTP(s)
-   Fancy, Reactive, Fast UI/UX
-   Status and Latency Chart

And dozens of smaller features to be added.

## Getting started

This is the current state of building the app. Actively working to make this process much more streamlined!

First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

```shell
air
cd web && npm run dev
```
